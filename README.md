# DeepLearning

- Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks.
- It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data.
- In These Deeplearningprojects I have Used Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow . 

# Objectives of DeepLearning Projects Over here
- Building powerful image classification models using very little data
- Using image data-augmentation techniques
- Calcualting model weights, stage-by-stage
- Saving model-weights and model-architecture to files
- Loading saved model-architecture and model-weights
- image classification using deep learning
- ransfer Learning: Building powerful image classification models using very little data using pre-trained applications
- Feature Enngineering: Using engineered features with Random Forest Classifier
- Learning Rate Annealing: Moderating Learning rate on/near plateau
- How Image augmentation is performed. Image augmentation basics
